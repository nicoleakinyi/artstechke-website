              We don't want our children to see STEAM [Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics]
              fields as rocket science or imaginary, we want them to have a believe system that they can use
              STEAM to create solutions, therefore we are providing them with the tools need to make their
              dreams a reality. Through hands-on experiments, innovative projects, and engaging activities,
              we inspire them to explore their imaginations, develop critical thinking skills, and build a
              strong foundation for their future success in STEAM disciplines.

                  My 7 weeks spent in the ARTSKE Holiday Tech Camp was an exceptional experience. A very organized
                  curriculum and a very skilled team. I will confidently say it was an experience of a lifetime. Within
                  these few weeks with the kids, I came across the next Generation of tech giants. The enthusiasm
                  these kids carried everyday kept me on my heels with me at the end of each day hoping for the
                  following day to meet them once again. With this enthusiasm gotten from the participants of ARTSKE
                  Holiday Tech Camp 2023, I will say confidently that this Tech camp will produce Technology Giants.
